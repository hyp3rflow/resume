## 최용욱, Yongwook Choi

Software engineer specializing in web technologies. I enjoy immersing myself in new things, quickly learning them, and creating at a fast pace.\
I prefer work with TypeScript and have some experience with Scala, Swift, Rust, Kotlin, Go, and C++.

## Work experiences

### PortOne (November 2022 - February 2023)

#### Developer Experience Engineer

I worked on maintenance for new versions of [iamport-react-native](https://github.com/iamport/iamport-react-native), [iamport_flutter](https://github.com/iamport/iamport_flutter), and [iamport-ios](https://github.com/iamport/iamport-ios).\
I also participated in the creation of the [PortOne renewed landing page](https://portone.io), which supports multiple locales, using solid-start and hygraph.\
Additionally, I contributed the schema review of the V2 API and worked on the initial version of the developer center, which renders documentation from OpenAPI schemas.

### Riiid (March 2021 - October 2022)

#### Developer Experience Engineer (2022~)

I have been developing in-house productivity tools such as [pbkit](https://github.com/pbkit/pbkit), [vscode-pbkit](https://github.com/pbkit/vscode-pbkit), [pbkit-devtools](https://github.com/pbkit/pbkit-devtools), [urichk](https://github.com/riiid/urichk), and [riiidx](https://github.com/riiid/riiidx). To facilitate schema-first development with protobuf on the client side, I contributed to [pbkit](https://github.com/pbkit/pbkit), which is actively used within the company.

I also developed WRP, a protobuf-based communication bridge that enables schema-first development between native apps and webviews within the apps. I participated in the design and debugging of the TypeScript and Kotlin implementations and contributed to the Swift implementation: [wrp-ts](https://github.com/pbkit/wrp-ts), [wrp-swift](https://github.com/pbkit/wrp-swift), [wrp-kt](https://github.com/pbkit/wrp-kt), [docs](https://wrp.deno.dev).

In addition, I developed [urichk](https://github.com/riiid/urichk), a tool that defines accessible web view URIs and deep links with custom schemas, enabling secure development through the generated code.

When encountering issues during open-source development, I usually fix and contribute them directly whenever possible. 
(denoland/node_deno_shims [#92](https://github.com/denoland/node_deno_shims/pull/92), [#95](https://github.com/denoland/node_deno_shims/pull/95), [#98](https://github.com/denoland/node_deno_shims/pull/98), denoland/dnt [#141](https://github.com/denoland/dnt/pull/141), [#144](https://github.com/denoland/dnt/pull/144), denoland/deno [#14007](https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/14007), denoland/deno_std [#2039](https://github.com/denoland/deno_std/pull/2039)).

#### Frontend Engineer (~2022)

I developed the Santa product and was responsible for maintaining the design system used within the team.\
While working on product development, I also contributed productivity tools, such as Slack deployment notifications and Figma comment alerts.
